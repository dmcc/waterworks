<h1>waterworks (embarassingly unfinished edition)</h1>

Collected library tools by David McClosky and Drew Perttula (though I should mention that Drew is not responsible for maintaining this and at time of press does not even know I'm mentioning him in this file).<p>

In fact, I am calling this release 0.1<i>e</i> -- <i>e</i> for embarassing.  I hope to clean it up and document it more Real Soon Now.  The main reason I am releasing it is as support for some of my other (slightly) more polished software.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Standard distutils install hopefully works.  Please email me if you have any problems.
